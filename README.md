# SirMathays Presents: A Dark Theme

This is just a very simple dark theme, with every background going with a black/gray background except the editor which has slight blueish hue. Turquoise works as an accent color here and there.

Editor colors otherwise is based on my color theme of choice, [Sunburst](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gerane.Theme-Sunburst)! That's what I've always been using in different editors and was happy to find it in Visual Studio Code as well!
